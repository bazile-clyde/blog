I generally prefer command-line tools over anything graphical. I don&rsquo;t enjoy
having to keep three different social applications running (Discord, Slack,
WhatsApp, IRC, ..), most of them with different notification sound,
specificity&rsquo;s and design.
I concentrate much better when I have the same design, keybindings, and
experience than having to switch between  different layouts. I find <ctrl><tab>
expensive and tiring, specially when I have more than two programs running.
