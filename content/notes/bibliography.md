                  interconnect tens of billions of new devices, in large part
                  also connected to the Internet. IoT devices include both
                  high-end devices which can use traditional go-to operating
                  systems (OSs) such as Linux, and low-end devices which cannot,
                  due to stringent resource constraints, e.g., very limited
                  memory, computational power, and power supply. However,
                  large-scale IoT software development, deployment, and
                  maintenance requires an appropriate OS to build upon. In this
                  paper, we thus analyze in detail the specific requirements
                  that an OS should satisfy to run on low-end IoT devices, and
                  we survey applicable OSs, focusing on candidates that could
                  become an equivalent of Linux for such devices, i.e., a
                  one-size-fits-most, open source OS for low-end IoT devices.},

  publisher       = {Morgan and Claypool Publishers},
  abstract        = {For many years, most computer architects have pursued one
                  primary goal: performance. Architects have translated the
                  ever-increasing abundance of ever-faster transistors provided
                  by Moore's law into remarkable increases in performance.
                  Recently, however, the bounty provided by Moore's law has been
                  accompanied by several challenges that have arisen as devices
                  have become smaller, including a decrease in dependability due
                  to physical faults. In this book, we focus on the
                  dependability challenge and the fault tolerance solutions that
                  architects are developing to overcome it. The two main
                  purposes of this book are to explore the key ideas in
                  fault-tolerant computer architecture and to present the
                  current state-of-the-art - over approximately the past 10
                  years - in academia and industry. Table of Contents:

  abstract        = {Embedded systems used in harsh environments are susceptible
                  to bit-flips, which can cause data flow errors. In order to
                  increase the reliability of embedded systems, numerous data
                  flow error detection techniques have already been developed.
                  It is, however, difficult to identify the best technique to
                  apply, due to differences in the way they are evaluated in
                  current literature.This paper presents an empirical
                  comparative study of seven existing techniques. We measured
                  fault coverage, execution time overhead, and code size
                  overhead. We conclude that soft error detection using software
                  redundancy (SEDSR) and error detection by duplicated
                  instructions (EDDI) have a better trade-off between fault
                  coverage and overheads than software-implemented fault
                  tolerance (SWIFT), critical block duplication (CBD), and
                  overhead reduction (VAR3+). Error detection by diverse data
                  and duplicated instructions (ED4I or EDDDDI) and software
                  approach (SA) had better fault coverage at the expense of
                  execution time and code size usage.},

                  for embedded systems programmers, students, and the curious to
                  a modern, popular, open architecture. RISC-V spans from the
                  cheapest 32-bit embedded microcontroller to the fastest 64-bit
                  cloud computer. The text shows how RISC-V followed the good
                  ideas of past architectures while avoiding their mistake.
                  Highlights include: Introduces the RISC-V instruction set in
                  only 100 pages, including 75 figures An Instruction Translator
                  Guide to help translate assembly language programs from ARM-32

                  quotes to pass along wisdom of noted scientists and engineers
                  Ten chapters introduce each component of the modular RISC-V
                  instruction set--often contrasting code compiled from C to
                  RISC-V versus the older ARM, Intel, and MIPS
                  architectures--but readers can start programming after Chapter
                  2. Praise for The RISC-V Reader: This timely book concisely
                  describes the simple, free and open RISC-V ISA that is
                  experiencing rapid uptake in many different computing sectors.
