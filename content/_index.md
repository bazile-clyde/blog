## Hi, there {#hi-there}

My name is Benjamin Mezger[^fn:1] and I am one of many software engineers lost in
a world of code and numbers. In my job, I work on a large Python code-base using
Django[^fn:2] and Wagtail[^fn:3] developing internal components for E-Commerce and
data processing.

I&rsquo;m interested in computer security[^fn:4], operating systems, and computer
architecture. I enjoy this so much, I developed a Microkernel for the RISC-V ISA
for my Bachelor thesis. Before starting university, I started working as a
backend developer. After started university, my interest in operating systems
and computer architecture grew, which was one of my motivations to write my
Bachelor thesis on this topic.

I tend to get thoughtful when asked &ldquo;_where are you from_&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s a
relatively long story. But here is a _TL;DR_ in some paragraphs:

I&rsquo;m born in Milan (Italy), however, my parents do not have Italian citizenship,
and Italy is one of the lists of countries which are _Jus sanguinis_. So I ended
up having German citizenship from my father.

My parents some years later moved to the south of Brazil, where I live for
around 3 years before my parents got divorced and my mother moved to Amsterdam
and I moved together with my father to Sark[^fn:5].

Two years later, we moved for about 4 months to Portugal and then back to
England, but this time, we moved to London.

After some years, I moved in with my mother in Amsterdam, where I stayed most of
my teenage years. When deciding where to get my bachelor&rsquo;s from, I traveled
around Europe and ended up studying in Brazil.
