My name is Benjamin Mezger[^fn:1] and I am one of countless software engineers
lost in a world of code and numbers. I am a software engineer at [Cheesecake
Labs](https://ckl.io), working on large Python code-bases, mainly monolithic [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) architecture
on a squad of 7 software engineers. I have worked with a variety of technologies
on different fields, from web development to back-end and operating system
development. This fields and technology exchange has taught me how to quickly
adapt contexts, better understand the computing abstractions in software, apply
them as required and visualize possible issues when writing code.

I doing my Master&rsquo;s degree at the [University of Vale do Itajaí](https://univali.br) in the field of
computer architecture and operating systems, researching software support in
relate to operating systems, for the RISC-V architecture in aerospace&rsquo;s
applications. Further, I have interest in computer security, operating systems,
and computer architecture.

I worked 4 years as a researcher at the laboratory of Distributed Systems at the
University of Vale do Itajaí. I jumped across different fields while working as
a researcher, but I mainly worked with IoT software, system programming, and web
applications.

I tend to get reflective when asked &ldquo;_where are you from_&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s a long
and confusing story. But here is a _TL;DR_:

I was born in Milan in 1994, but due to _Jus sanguinis_, I ended up having my
father&rsquo;s German citizenship.
Years later after moving around Italy and Germany, we moved to south of Brazil,
where we lived for 3 years before my parents got divorced. My mother moved to
Amsterdam, myself, my sister, stepmother, and father moved to [Sark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sark). Two years
later, we moved to Portugal and then back to England, but this time, London. I
later moved in with my mother a year later to Amsterdam, where I lived most of
my teenage years. I later moved to Brazil for studying my Bachelor in Computer
Science.
