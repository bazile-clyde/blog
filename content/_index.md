_Howdy_!

I am Benjamin Mezger, but everyone started calling me Ben at some point in life.
I am one of the countless software engineers lost in a world of code, numbers,
and countries â€” yes, not only code and numbers but also countries. Countries
because ever since I was born, I&rsquo;ve moved and had to learn multiple languages to
communicate with my friends and family. Maybe that&rsquo;s why I am a software
engineer because computers have different ways of communicating.

Talking about life and code, check my [/notes](/notes) section for some of my writings.
