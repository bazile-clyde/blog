My name is Benjamin Mezger[^fn:1], and I am one of the countless software
engineers lost in a world of code and numbers. I have worked with a diverse
number of technologies – from operating system development to web development.
This experience with several computing abstractions has taught me how to quickly
adapt, learn and contribute to different project environments. I have an
interest in backend development, computer architecture, and operating systems.

I am doing my Master&rsquo;s degree at the University of Vale do Itajaí, investigating
fault-tolerant software at the operating system level on RISC-V architectures.

I tend to reflect when asked, &ldquo;where are you from&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s a long and
confusing story. But here is a _TL;DR_: I was born in Milan, I have Brazillian,
Dutch, and German citizenship, but I&rsquo;m not Italian due to Jus Sanguinis. I moved
and lived in Italy, Portugal, United Kingdom, Channel Islands, The Netherlands,
and Brazil.

If you want to know more about my professional career, you can get my CV
[here](/files/Benjamin_Mezger_CV.pdf) or the short version [here](/files/Benjamin_Mezger_CV_short.pdf).
