My name is Benjamin Mezger[^fn:1] and I am one of many software
engineers lost in a world of code and numbers.
In my job, I work on a large Python codebase using Django[^fn:2] and
Wagtail[^fn:3] developing internal components for an E-Commerce and data
processing.

I am interested in computer security[^fn:4], operating systems and computer
architecture. In fact, I enjoy this so much, I developed a Microkernel for the
RISC-V ISA for my Bachelor thesis.

Though I have triple nationality[^fn:5], I grew up in Amsterdam, but I am
currently an exchange student in Brazil.
