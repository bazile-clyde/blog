My name is Benjamin Mezger[^fn:1], and I am one of the countless software engineers
lost in a world of code and numbers. I am a software engineer at [Cheesecake
Labs](https://ckl.io), working on large Python codebases, mainly monolithic Django architecture,
on a squad of 7 software engineers. I have worked with various technologies in
different fields, from web development to back-end and operating system
development. These fields and technology exchange has taught me how to quickly
adapt contexts, understand the computing abstractions in software, apply them as
required, and visualize possible issues when writing code.

I am doing my Master’s degree at the University of Vale do Itajaí in computer
architecture and operating systems, researching software support concerning
operating systems for the RISC-V architecture in aerospace applications.
Further, I have an interest in computer security, operating systems, and
computer architecture.

I worked for four years as a researcher at the laboratory of Distributed Systems
at the University of Vale do Itajaí. I jumped across different fields while
working as a researcher, but I mainly worked with IoT software, system
programming, and web applications.

I tend to reflect when asked, “where are you from” because it’s a long and
confusing story. But here is a TL;DR:

I was born in Milan in 1994, but due to Jus sanguinis, I ended up having my
father’s German citizenship. Years later, after moving around Italy and Germany,
we moved to the south of Brazil, where we lived for three years before my
parents got divorced. My mother moved to Amsterdam, myself, my sister,
stepmother, and father moved to Sark. Two years later, we moved to Portugal and
then back to England, but this time, London. I later moved in with my mother a
year later to Amsterdam, where I lived most of my teenage years. I later moved
to Brazil for studying my Bachelor in Computer Science.
